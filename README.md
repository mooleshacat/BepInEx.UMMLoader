# BepInEx.UMMLoader (compiled)

A BepInEx-compatible loader for [UnityModManager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).

Working on compiling for your convenience :) Install instructions coming soon!

Current version is based on UMM 0.15.0 and supports all of its functionalities.  
Parts of the source was rewritten for clarity and integration with BepInEx.

Written for BepInEx 5, which you can currently get as [bleeding edge builds](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepinex_be).

*Currently WIP, but functional*
