# BepInEx.UMMLoader

A BepInEx-compatible loader for [UnityModManager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).

Current version is based on UMM 0.15.0 and supports all of its functionalities.  
Parts of the source was rewritten for clarity and integration with BepInEx.

Written for BepInEx 5, which you can currently get as [bleeding edge builds](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepinex_be).

*Currently WIP, but functional*

*would be compiled by now if namespace errors did not exist - missing BepInEx namespace*
